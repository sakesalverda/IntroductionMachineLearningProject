Our company data is from: 2020-01-01 till 2023-01-04 (yyyy-mm-dd)
And we have to predict **next 15 days**

Therefore we must have weather data available from 2020-01-01 till 2023-01-19

The data downloaded is hourly, the _historical_ is up until 3 months ago and the _recent_ includes the last 4 months measurements

Precipitation (hourly)
- Take average between opening times or take sum between opening times?

Temperature (hourly)
- Take average, minimum or maximum between opening times (maybe even columns for several hours, model find might more important hour)?
